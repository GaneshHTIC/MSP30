IT DEALS WITH BASIC ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSIONS AS THE MP430F5529 CONTAINS 12 BIT ADC IT WILL MAPPED TO 4096 CONVERSIONS SO THAT IS WE HAVE USED IN CONVERSION CALCULATIONS.HERE IN MSP430 WE ARE HAVING PINS WITH EACH PIN HAVING MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY SO BY SELECTION USING PINSEL WE ARE MAKING THE P6.1 PINS SPECIAL ROLE THAT IS THE ANALOG INPUT ROLE IS TURNED ON .AND AAFTER TAKING THE INPUT FROM ANALOG READ WE HAVE TO CONFIGURE THE ADC BASED ON OUR REQUIREMENT .THE CONFIGURATION INVOLVES SETTING CLOCK SETTING REFERENCE SETTING SAMPLING INTERVAL SETTING ETC.THE CALIBERATION IS DONE WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.THE ADC CAN BE OPERATED IN 4 MODES AS LIKE CONTINOUS CONVERSION,AUTO SCAN..ETC..THESE ARE ASLO CONFIGURED USING CONFIGURATION COMMANDS.THE ADC CAN BE OPERATED IN  8 BIT10 BIT OR 12 BIT BASED ON REQUIREMENT THESE ARE AMONG THINGS TO BE CONFIGURED.THIS IS HOW ADC IS CONFIGURED FOR READING POT READINGS.
 
AFTER CONVERSION OF DIGITAL EQUIVALENT TO ANALOG USING ABOVE PROCESS WE WILL BE OBTAINING A VOLTAGE EQUIVALENT .IN LM35 FOR EVERY 10 DEG CHANGE IN TEMPARATURE THE VOLTAGE EQUIVALENT WILL BE INCREASED BY 10MV .AFTER  OBTAINING  VOLTAGE WE OBTAIN TEMPARATURE BY USING FORMULA T=V/10mv/deg c.
